# Claude Code Context

This document gives you (Claude Code) the context to keep building **AR Tools**, an internal agency suite. **Read this first before any other action.**

> **Suite context (read alongside this file).** AR Tools is a **multi-module suite** — Blog Writer, Local SEO content, Keyword research, Organic + Maps rank trackers, a Ranking-drop agent, and a VA content scheduler — sharing one dashboard, one Supabase database, and one scheduler. For suite-level scope, the locked architectural decisions, and the phased roadmap, see **`docs/suite-architecture-and-roadmap-v1_0.md`** (this is the product/architecture authority for "how many tools is this"). The Blog Writer's engineering spec and module PRDs remain authoritative for that module's *internals*.

## What this project is

An internal agency suite for SEO/content work across multiple SMB clients. The team picks a client, then works across SEO modules from one dashboard. The first and most-built module is the **Blog Writer**, which generates SEO + AEO-optimized content through a five-module pipeline: enter a keyword for a configured client and the platform produces a publication-ready Markdown article (and can publish it as a Google Doc in the client's Drive folder).

This is **not** a customer-facing SaaS. There's no billing, no customer signup, no marketing site. Internal team use only.

## Current state (what's built vs. what's ahead)

Most of the original Blog Writer build is **done**. Don't treat this repo as greenfield — read the code before assuming something is unbuilt.

**Built and working:**

- **Pipeline API** (`writer/pipeline-api/`) — all five modules: `brief`, `sie`, `research`, `writer`, `sources_cited`.
- **Platform API** (`writer/platform-api/`) — JWT auth middleware; clients CRUD; file upload + parsing; website scraper async worker (`services/job_worker.py` + `services/website_scraper.py` polling `async_jobs`); orchestrator + run dispatch (`services/orchestrator.py`); run polling; briefs; silos (`services/silo_dedup.py`, `services/silo_promotion.py`); publish to Google Drive (`routers/publish.py` via Apps Script webhook); users; **Local SEO** backend (`routers/local_seo.py` + `services/local_seo_service.py`, calling the private `nlp-api`).
- **NLP API** (`writer/nlp-api/`) — private Railway service powering the Local SEO module: competitor SERP analysis (DataForSEO → ScrapeOwl → **TextRazor** entities — replaced Google Cloud NLP for cost + Wikipedia/Wikidata linking) and Claude page generation + 8-engine page scoring/auto-reoptimization. Ported from the imported ShowUP Local app; auth-less (private network only, like pipeline-api). See its `README.md` for what was stripped.
- **Suite features added since the original spec:** Google Business Profile (GBP) auto-fetch + review enrichment via DataForSEO/Outscraper (`services/gbp_service.py`), incl. paste-a-link/share-link resolution (`/clients/gbp/resolve`) and auto-fill of client name/website from a selected GBP; content silos (semantic dedup / auto-promotion); client workspace with content + rank-tracker sections; suite dashboard with per-client tiles, including **logo branding** (`clients.logo_url`, public `client-logos` storage bucket); **reference page structures** — four per-client reference page URLs (local landing / service / location / blog post) whose structure is scraped + analyzed (ScrapeOwl fetch → heuristic chrome strip via BeautifulSoup → Claude outline + NL summary) and stored indefinitely on `clients.page_structures` (JSONB, keyed by page type), captured via the `page_structure_scrape` async job (`services/page_structure_scraper.py` + `job_worker._run_page_structure_scrape`), frozen into the run snapshot (`client_context_snapshots.page_structures`) and rendered (`services/page_structure_render.py`, **mode-aware**: `mode="full"` emits the outline + a forceful "replication checklist" for whole-page mirrors; `mode="opening"` emits an opening-only block for the blog intro) into a "mirror this layout" prompt block for the writing modules: **service** → service_brief synthesis (schema bumped `1.0`→**`1.1`**), **local landing/location** → nlp `/generate-page` (reuses its `page_template_url` "structure to mirror" path via a new `reference_page_structure` field), **blog post** → the Writer's intro (schema bumped `1.8`→**`1.9`**; the blog brief stays client-agnostic + globally cached, so it can't carry client layout — the Writer honors the opening pattern instead; fuller blog heading-level mirroring is a follow-up). Tuning the fidelity of this mirroring has a deterministic, no-LLM **structural-fidelity eval** (`services/page_structure_eval.py` extracts a generated page's outline from HTML/Markdown and scores section-count/heading-order/block-type/element recall vs. the stored reference; CLI at `scripts/eval_page_structure.py`) — run it against live-generated pages to drive prompt tuning (the sandbox can't call the live LLM/SERP stack).
- **Organic Rank Tracker** (#4) — hybrid GSC + DataForSEO rank tracker on each client workspace. **Built (all milestones except alerting):** GSC service-account connection + verify-access (`services/gsc_service.py`, `routers/gsc.py`); daily GSC ingest → `gsc_query_daily` + weekly query×page → `gsc_query_page_daily`, with `sync_runs` observability (`services/gsc_ingest.py`); the **shared scheduler** — an in-process asyncio loop enqueuing jobs into `async_jobs` (`services/gsc_scheduler.py`); the materialized null date-axis `rank_keyword_metrics` + computed status taxonomy (`services/rank_materialize.py`, `services/rank_status.py`); the **automatic GSC→DataForSEO fallback** (client-anchored keywords; DataForSEO weekly live rank when GSC can't cover a keyword — `services/dataforseo_rank.py`); keyword market data CPC/volume/competition + est. value (`services/keyword_market.py`); canonical-URL resolution + Pages view; striking-distance discovery; deindex **URL Inspection** confirmation; historical backfill; per-keyword page breakdown; canonical pinning; CSV export. API in `routers/rank.py`. **Remaining: alerting** (gated on the notifications service). Authoritative doc: **`docs/modules/organic-rank-tracker-prd-v1_0.md`**.
- **GSC Research** — on-demand opportunity analysis from a **live Search Console query×page pull** (reusing `gsc_service.fetch_search_analytics`, dims `[query, page]`, ~90-day window — like the n8n flow's "last 3 months"), ported from the "GSC Research" n8n workflow. One run (`gsc_research_runs` table, JSONB result sets) surfaces three opportunity types: **keyword cannibalization** (a query split across >1 URL where every URL ranks ≤30 and impressions are clustered within 50% — Google can't pick a page), **quick wins** (query×page at position 6–10), and **hidden wins** (query×page at position 11–30 with ≥5 impressions). Quick/hidden wins are enriched with DataForSEO market data (CPC/volume/competition) by reusing `services/keyword_market.py` + its cross-client cache. Thresholds are fixed (encode the workflow's heuristics; the source workflow's small position gap at (10,11] between the two win bands is replicated intentionally). Standalone module: `services/gsc_research.py` (pure analysis helpers + the `gsc_research` async job), `routers/gsc_research.py`, frontend `pages/GscResearch.tsx` (three tabbed tables + per-table CSV export, polls while a run is in flight), launched from a client-workspace "GSC Research" card. **On-demand only** (no scheduling). Gated on the same verified GSC property + `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` as the rest of the rank tracker — runs complete with `gsc_connected=false` + empty results until a property is verified and the service account is configured.
- **Frontend** (`frontend/`) — shared React + Vite app: `Login`, `Home` (suite dashboard tiles), `Clients`, `ClientForm`, `ClientWorkspace`, `Runs`, `RunDetail`, `Silos`, `Articles`, `Rankings` (rank tracker — `components/rankings/`, dependency-free SVG charts), `GscResearch` (GSC opportunity analysis).

**In active integration (not finished):**

- **Local SEO content** module (#2). **Phases 0–1 done:** the NLP service is rehomed into the suite (`writer/nlp-api/`, deployed private on Railway) and platform-api has the backend (`local_seo_pages` table, generate/list/get routes). **Phase 2 (frontend) and Phase 3 (page-template field) remain.** The raw import still lives at `/local-seo-writer` as the reference copy. Scope/decisions and phasing are in **`docs/modules/local-seo-module-integration-plan-v1_0.md`** (chosen path: C — full port; cut from v1: client-site brand-voice/ICP scraping, the keyword-worthiness "rankability" check, and billing; competitor SERP analysis **always runs first** — originally a per-page opt-in via a `run_analysis` flag, but that opt-out was removed; the flag now defaults to True in nlp-api, and platform-api only sets it False as a degraded fallback when its own analysis attempt fails). **Plan Silo** (built since the original spec): the workspace's "Plan Silo" tab (`frontend/.../LocalSeoContent.tsx` + `services/local_seo_silo.py`, async `local_seo_silo` job) takes a seed **service + area** and runs the **Fanout pipeline by import** (silo discovery → expansion → relevance gate → Louvain clustering) to surface candidate page targets grouped by silo, each marked found/missing vs `local_seo_pages`, selectable for sequential **bulk-create**. **Neighborhoods silo** (added since): on top of the Fanout service silos, the planner appends a geocoding-verified **"Neighborhoods"** silo — it proposes the target city's sub-areas (Haiku tool-use, `local_seo_neighborhood_model`, in whatever local term fits the country: neighborhoods/suburbs/districts), then **forward-geocodes** the city + each candidate (`services/maps_geocode.forward_geocode_places` + `geocode_forward_cache` table; migrations `20260625130000` + `20260625140000` which adds `country`/`bounds`) and keeps only those whose centre falls **inside the city's geocoded footprint** (`place_is_within_city` — country-agnostic: it verifies *geography*, not name nesting, so it works for a US neighborhood nested in the city's locality **and** an AU/UK suburb that is its own locality; drops adjacent towns, oversized regions like counties/states, and centroid-fallback bogus names). Containment uses Google's `bounds`/`viewport` box (padded by `local_seo_city_bounds_pad`), falling back to a `local_seo_neighborhood_radius_km` radius when a city has no box. Offers `"<service> <sub-area>"` page targets through the same bulk-create. Best-effort + gated on the Anthropic + server-side `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` (Geocoding-enabled); absent either, the silo is skipped with a degraded note and the rest of the plan is unaffected. Search-volume prioritization on candidates is a deliberate follow-up (not built).

- **Keyword research — Topic Fanout Tool: consolidated into this repo, LIVE.** The standalone Topic Fanout app (`kssabraw/info-site-kw-research-cluster`) was folded in as a **code-only** consolidation (one login, one URL — same Supabase project, all its tables already live in the **`fanout`** schema, same Supabase-JWT auth). Its FastAPI backend is **vendored at `writer/platform-api/fanout/`** (self-contained: its own `config.py`, its own `fanout`-schema-scoped Supabase client, its own auth deps) and **mounted under `/fanout`** in `main.py` (routers: sessions/projects/exports/schedules/healthz; its in-process content scheduler runs from the platform-api lifespan alongside `job_worker`/`gsc_scheduler`). Its React app is **vendored at `fanout-frontend/`** (its own React 18 / Vite 5 toolchain) and built into the Netlify site under **`/fanout`** by `netlify-build.sh` (a combined two-app build; see `netlify.toml`), launched from the client-workspace **Content Scheduler** card. A suite `admin` is bridged to a Fanout `owner` in `ensure_user_profile`. Deps reconciled in `requirements.txt` — notably **`openai>=1.66`** (the Fanout silo-discovery uses the OpenAI **Responses API** `client.responses`), `anthropic>=0.39`, plus spaCy/lxml/networkx/numpy/etc. (the Dockerfile bakes the spaCy `en_core_web_sm` model). New env on `PLATFORM`: `SCRAPEOWL_API_KEY` + `TEXTRAZOR_API_KEY` (everything else was already shared); Netlify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` = the platform URL + `/fanout`. **Don't treat `fanout/` or `fanout-frontend/` as the source of truth** — they're vendored; the Topic Fanout PRDs/build plans live in the source repo. **Suite extension — Local SEO pages as a Fanout content type (additive divergence from upstream):** the Fanout content scheduler can now mass-create **Local SEO pages** as well as blog posts. A `content_type` (`blog_post` | `local_seo_page`) + `location`/`location_code` on `fanout.content_schedules` (migration `20260623120000_fanout_schedule_content_type.sql`) drives a per-run branch in `fanout/writer/scheduler.py::_process_run`: `local_seo_page` runs call `fanout/jobs.py::generate_local_seo_page_core`, which reuses the suite's `services/local_seo_service.generate_page` (the nlp-api generator — competitor analysis + Claude + 8-engine scoring/reopt) **by import** (Fanout is mounted inside platform-api; no circular import — the service never imports fanout). Pages persist to the suite's **`local_seo_pages`** (first-class: scorable/reoptimizable/publishable, visible in the client workspace), **not** `fanout.article_outputs`. Requires the session to be **client-linked** (`fanout.sessions.client_id`) with a target `location` — validated at schedule-create (`fanout/api/schedules.py`); selector in `fanout-frontend/src/shared/ScheduleModal.tsx`. This **diverges the vendored copy from the standalone Topic Fanout repo** (accepted; kept additive). v1 follow-ups: the schedule cost estimate still uses the blog per-article constant (so the VA $90 gate only approximates for local SEO); the location is free-text (no typeahead in fanout-frontend yet). **Open follow-ups:** (1) decommission the now-redundant standalone `info-site-kw-research-cluster` Railway service (kept until the consolidated path is fully trusted); (2) a pre-existing Fanout UI polling rough-edge can render "pipeline complete · 0 keywords" before the relevance gate finishes writing `active` statuses (a stale summary read — the data is correct; a refresh shows the real counts).

**Not yet built (suite roadmap, in rough order):** Ranking-drop agent, VA content scheduler, the **SOP store**, and the **notifications service**. (Keyword research is now **done** — the Topic Fanout Tool was consolidated in; see the bullet just above.) (Maps / local-pack geo-grid ranker #5 is **built** — Local Dominator, `services/local_dominator.py` + `services/maps_grid.py` + `routers/maps.py` + `pages/MapsGeogrid.tsx`; pending a live smoke-test. Includes a per-keyword **Local Rank Analysis report** auto-generated when a scan completes: deterministic ring/octant rollups (`services/maps_analytics.py`) + the octant-based hyper-local pin generator (`services/maps_octants.py`, ported from an n8n flow) + a Claude **Sonnet** narrative (`services/maps_report.py`, async_jobs `maps_report`), surfaced in `MapsGeogrid.tsx`/`MapsReport.tsx` via a dependency-free `components/Markdown.tsx` and published to the client's Drive folder as a Google Doc (shared `services/google_docs.py`). **Run management** (added since the build): on-demand "Run scan now" (always existed), plus stop an in-flight/queued scan (status `cancelled` — drops the queued `maps_scan` job + halts polling), delete a finished run / "Clear all" history (cascades `maps_scan_results`), and a quick weekly-schedule on/off toggle — endpoints in `routers/maps.py` (`POST …/maps/scan/cancel`, `POST /maps-scans/{id}/cancel`, `DELETE /maps-scans/{id}`, `DELETE …/maps/scans`), helpers `cancel_client_scans`/`cancel_scan` in `services/local_dominator.py`, migration `20260623130000_maps_scan_cancelled.sql`. **Weak-zone geocoding** (added since the build): the Local Rank Analysis report now reverse-geocodes the geo-grid's weakest pins into real city names so the team can target local SEO work at actual places, not just compass directions — `services/maps_geocode.py` (pure helpers: weak-cell extraction from `rank_grid`, Google address parsing, locality aggregation; plus async Google Geocoding with a cross-client `maps_geocode_cache` keyed by rounded lat/lng) runs inside `maps_report.generate_report_for_result`, persisting `maps_scan_results.report_weak_locations` — octant pins labelled with their nearest city + weak cells aggregated into ranked nearby "weak coverage areas" (city, pin count, octants, worst/avg rank, a representative point) with per-area Google Maps deep links — and feeds the town names into the report narrative's weaknesses section. Surfaced in `MapsGeogrid.tsx` (a "Weak coverage areas (nearby cities)" table + a Nearby-city column on the pin table) and the printable `MapsReport.tsx`. Needs a server-side `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` (Geocoding-enabled, distinct from the frontend `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`) on `PLATFORM`; absent it the report is unchanged minus the place names (`geocoded=false`). Tunables in `config.py`: `maps_weak_rank_threshold`, `maps_geocode_max_cells`. Migration `20260625120000_maps_weak_locations.sql`.) The roadmap doc has the full module table, groupings, and locked decisions. (Organic Rank Tracker #4 is built except alerting — see above; the **shared scheduler** is decided + built as the asyncio loop in `services/gsc_scheduler.py`; the **GSC analytics layer** is realized by the rank tracker's GSC ingest. Local SEO content #2 is mid-integration — see above.)

## The reference documents

Before writing code, read the ones relevant to your task. Note the exact filenames — several differ from older references.

1. **`docs/suite-architecture-and-roadmap-v1_0.md`** — Suite-level scope, the locked decision log (rank sources, GSC service-account auth, publish destination, etc.), shared infrastructure, and the proposed data model for unbuilt modules. The product/architecture authority for the suite.
2. **`docs/engineering-implementation-spec-v1_1.md`** — Primary implementation reference for the Blog Writer. Service topology, schema, API routes, orchestration patterns, file parsing, frontend architecture, deployment sequence.
3. **`docs/content-platform-prd-v1_4.md`** — Current product spec (supersedes `content-platform-prd-v1_3.md`, which is retained). Overall context, business rules, role permissions, brand-vs-SIE precedence rules.
4. **`docs/content-quality-prd-v1_0.md`** — Cross-cutting content quality requirements (R1–R7): semantic heading dedup, SERP sanitization, topic adherence, required structural elements (Key Takeaways / APP intro / CTA), brand context injection, paragraph length cap, external citation coverage.
5. **`docs/writer-module-v1_5-change-spec_2.md`** — Writer Module v1.5 update. Adds `client_context` input, brand voice distillation, brand-SIE reconciliation. Authoritative for those features.
6. **`docs/modules/`** — Individual module PRDs:
   - `content-brief-generator-prd-v2_0.md` (Brief Generator — now v2.0)
   - `SIE_PRD_Term_Entity_Module.md`
   - `research-citations-module-prd-v1_1_1.md`
   - `content-writer-module-prd-v1.3.md` (check the header for its canonical version)
   - `sources-cited-module-prd-v1_1.md`
   - `local-seo-module-integration-plan-v1_0.md` (Local SEO module #2 — scope, cut list, and Path-C phasing; authoritative for that integration)
   - `organic-rank-tracker-prd-v1_0.md` (Organic Rank Tracker #4 — hybrid GSC + DataForSEO, the auto-fallback, data model, and milestone status; authoritative for that module)

When docs conflict: the engineering spec wins for "how to build it," the product PRD wins for "what should it do," and the **content quality PRD overrides the module PRDs on R1–R7 acceptance criteria**. Where the suite roadmap and the older single-tool framing disagree on "how many tools is this," the roadmap wins.

## Infrastructure already provisioned

- Supabase project (`AR-Internal-Tools`, ref `wvcthtmmcmhkybcesirb`) with schema applied via migrations in `writer/supabase/migrations/`.
- Storage buckets: `files` (active), `article-assets` (v2 placeholder), `csv-snapshots`, `wordpress_images` (public), `client-logos` (public — client tile/workspace logos).
- First admin user in `auth.users` with `role = 'admin'` in `profiles`.
- GitHub repo cloned. Railway project (`ar-tools`) with **three** services and env vars set: `PLATFORM` (platform-api), `pipeline` (pipeline-api), and `nlp` (nlp-api, private-only — no public domain; reachable at `http://nlp.railway.internal:8080`). Note: the `nlp` service has **no deploy-time healthcheck** (a private service can't pass Railway's probe — see `writer/nlp-api/README.md`); `healthcheckPath` must stay empty.

- **Rank tracker env vars:** DataForSEO creds (`DATAFORSEO_LOGIN`/`DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD`) are already set on `PLATFORM` (shared with GBP enrichment), so the DataForSEO rank + market paths work today. The GSC path needs `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` (the full service-account key JSON) on `PLATFORM` — **not yet provisioned**; until it's set, the rank tracker runs in DataForSEO-only mode and GSC verify/ingest show a "not configured" state. Provisioning it requires creating a GCP service account + enabling the Search Console API (a dashboard step — stop and confirm with the user).

You should NOT need dashboard-level setup. If you think you do, stop and ask.

## Conventions to follow

### Naming

- Modules and files: `snake_case.py`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Functions and variables: `snake_case`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Pydantic models: `PascalCase` ending in purpose (e.g., `ClientCreateRequest`, `RunDetailResponse`)

### Error handling

- Always raise `HTTPException` with a string error code in the detail (matches the standardized error envelope from Engineering Spec §5.0)
- Never expose stack traces to the frontend — log them server-side, return `internal_error` code
- Use `try/except` around external API calls; map provider errors to platform errors

### Logging

- Use `structlog` (or stdlib `logging` with JSON formatter) for structured JSON logs to stdout
- Always include `run_id` and `request_id` in log lines via context vars (Engineering Spec §13)
- Never log: JWTs, full brand guide text, API keys, user passwords

### Database access

- All Supabase calls from the backend use the **service role key** (not anon key) — RLS would block service operations
- Always wrap Supabase calls in try/except; map errors to user-friendly responses
- Schema changes go through migrations in `writer/supabase/migrations/` (apply to the live project via the Supabase MCP when working web-only)

### Module schema versions

The orchestrator validates `schema_version` from every pipeline response against `EXPECTED_MODULE_VERSIONS` (`writer/platform-api/services/orchestrator.py`). When you change a module, keep these in sync. Current values:

| Module | `schema_version` |
|---|---|
| Brief Generator | `2.8` |
| SIE | `1.4` |
| Research & Citations | `1.1` |
| Writer | `1.9` (also accepts `1.9-no-context` / `1.9-degraded`; `1.8` variants still accepted) |
| Sources Cited | `1.1` |

> These drift over time — treat `orchestrator.py` (`EXPECTED_MODULE_VERSIONS` / `WRITER_ACCEPTED_VERSIONS`) and each module's `SCHEMA_VERSION` constant as the source of truth, and update this table when you change them.

### Testing

- Write at least one happy-path test per module's core logic
- Mock external API calls (DataForSEO, ScrapeOwl, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google NLP) — never hit them in tests
- Existing tests are pure service-logic units mocked with `unittest.mock` (see `writer/platform-api/tests/`); there is no FastAPI `TestClient` harness yet
- For the Writer's brand-SIE reconciliation logic, build the test fixtures from the Writer v1.5 spec

## Things to ask before doing

These decisions are not in the docs — ask the user:

1. Specific Anthropic model selection per module (Sonnet vs Opus per task), where not already chosen in code
2. Specific prompt copy for distillation, reconciliation, website/GBP extraction (the docs describe behavior, not exact prompts)
3. Observability tooling beyond stdlib logging (Sentry, Better Stack, etc.) — planned for v2
4. Whether to add automated tests in CI on push, or rely on manual testing
5. Branch protection rules and PR requirements
6. Alerting/notifications delivery channels (in-app feed vs email/Slack + the provider/webhook details) before building the notifications service / rank-tracker alerting

> **Resolved:** the **shared scheduler** mechanism is decided — an in-process asyncio loop in platform-api (`services/gsc_scheduler.py`) that enqueues jobs into `async_jobs`; reuse it for future scheduled trackers rather than adding new infra.

## Things NOT to do without asking

- Don't change the service topology (e.g., split modules into separate Railway services)
- Don't add a queueing system beyond the `async_jobs` table
- Don't introduce new external dependencies (Redis, Celery, RabbitMQ, etc.)
- Don't add a caching layer in front of Supabase
- Don't change the brand-vs-SIE precedence rules
- Don't reverse a locked decision in the suite roadmap's decision log
- Don't expose the pipeline-api or nlp-api publicly — they must remain on Railway's private network (the `nlp` service is intentionally private + auth-less)
- Don't implement features marked "out of scope for v1" in the PRDs (e.g., live-to-CMS publishing)
- Don't re-add the Local SEO features cut from v1 (client-site brand-voice/ICP scraping, the keyword-worthiness "rankability" check, billing/credits) without agreement — see the integration plan
- Don't edit `/local-seo-writer` expecting it to ship — it's the raw reference copy; active Local SEO work goes in `writer/nlp-api/` plus the suite frontend/backend

## When you're stuck

If something seems underspecified or contradictory, stop and ask. The user has been deeply involved in spec design and prefers a quick clarifying question over a wrong assumption that's expensive to undo.

## How to communicate progress

After completing a meaningful chunk of work, summarize what you did, what you tested, and any open questions. Don't wait until everything is built to report status.
